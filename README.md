# What does it do?
When locking onto an enemy, your camera will focus on them. If you're too far from the enemy when you lock-on, you'll lose sight of the player. Additionally, during battle, you can gain/lose max HP, and so can your opponents.

# How to install?
Download the latest version of KHMI here https://github.com/synth-the-humanoid/KHMI/tree/master. Download all the files in LatestRelease/ModManager or LatestRelease/ModManagerCLI (command line variant). Then download LatestRelease/AdrenalineMix.dll from this repo and insert it into the mods folder of your ModManager. Then run ModManager and follow the prompts to get connected.
